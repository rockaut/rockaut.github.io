fischbacher.rocks is a privately owned and operated page run by Markus Fischbacher.
It is hosted on [Github](https://www.github.com) - you can find their own policy here [https://github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy). The domain is routed through cloudflare - their policy can be found here [https://www.cloudflare.com/gdpr/introduction/](https://www.cloudflare.com/gdpr/introduction/).
Based on Jekyll it only uses static HTML/JavaScript files and nothing else server side. All implemented services are tuned for GDPR as much as possible from me.

You may always browse the [sourcecode directly](https://github.com/rockaut/rockaut.github.io) and please feel free to report any issues.

## What personal data I collect and why I collect it

### Comments and Media
As comments and media uploads are completely absent there's nothing collected anyways.

### Analytics
This site doesn't use any analytics services.

### Cookies
This site doesn't even use cookies at all. Linked sites and pages may do. However, you may prefer to disable cookies on this site and on others. The most effective way to do this is to disable cookies in your browser. I suggest consulting the Help section of your browser or taking a look at the About Cookies website which offers guidance for all modern browsers.

### Embedded content from other websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

### Your contact information
For any concerns or comments, please contact fischbacher (dot) markus (at) gmail (dot) com or through an [GitHub repository issue](https://github.com/rockaut/rockaut.github.io/issues).
