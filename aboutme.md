First things first my name is Markus Fischbacher and I'm living near Salzburg, Austria.

fischbacher.rocks is my personal blog with my personal view. Just mine, just that.
It's also kind of a personal reminder for things I care and things I don't want to forget about.
But mostly it will focus on technology, hardware and software ... and games of course :D

Since my first contact with computers I was fascinated by programing. Early on, it were only games that captured my attention but as I realized that Austria isn't a good place for that so I shifted my focus on general computing. I started as a common administrator, installing PC and untangling Token-Ring-Networks or helping users resetting passwords. Over time I worked my way up to a Cloud-Service provider working with some cool people and even cooler technology.

Time comes, time goes. After just some short years I switched again and now I'm pinpointing my energies around monitoring solutions. It was one off my favourites all the years and now I can focus just on this specific branch.

Through all that time I kept contributing on Open Source Projects or at least patreoning if I can't contribute but using them. Give, not just use.
