      <description>First things first my name is Markus Fischbacher and I am living near Salzburg, Austria.
fischbacher.rocks is my personal blog with my personal view. Just mine, just that. It&amp;rsquo;s also kind of an personal reminder for things I care and things I don&amp;rsquo;t want to forget about. But mostly it will focus on technology &amp;hellip; and games :D
Since my first contact with computers i was fascinated on programing. Early on it were only games that captured my attention but as i realized that austria isn&amp;rsquo;t a good market for that i shifted my focus on general computing.</description>
