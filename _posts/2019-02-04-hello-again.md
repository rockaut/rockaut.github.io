As I'm in an active job shift again, I had to move my domain and blog. Luckily I haven't had much ... or like any ... real content online so I decided to switch completely to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

<!--more-->

I first had a look in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site generator but ... what a mess! After some days struggling I stumbled over [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) thanks to [Golang Weekly](https://golangweekly.com/) and it had an instant appeal to me. A single portable binary with clean CLI and a healthy community built already. Whole site clearly structuated an all clear coded. I quickly got grip with it and with [Beautiful Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/beautifulhugo/) found a theme I liked pretty well. Thought it took me some more weeks and an infection of the lateral pharyngeal bands to finally bring it up online.

Hopefully I will find more time and especially have more drive to post more. I already have some ideas to get started but first I want to find a good way to implement/link to my favorite tools here. They deserve better than a simple link list so I thought about short blog posts with good tags or a dedicated page.
